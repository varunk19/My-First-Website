# My-First-Website
My first website which is a model of a website that would give information of the Olympics 2020.

This project took me 4 days to complete it which also involved brushing up on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and PHP skills.
This website connects to a MySQL database created using the actual MySQL command line client software.
The index.php is the home page which would give the latest news.
The standings.php would give country-wise information of the number of gold, silver, bronze and the total medals of each country.
The upcoming.php would give information about the upcoming games and their start time.
The ongoing.php would give information about the games that are currently ongoing with the current score.
The results.php can be navigated to by clicking on a country's information on the standings.php page and it would give player-wise
information of that country.
